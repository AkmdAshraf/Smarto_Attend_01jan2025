                    <p>The Smarto Attend application is provided as an automated face-recognition based attendance
                        tracking system. While we strive for accuracy, the system is intended to assist in attendance
                        management and should not be used as the sole basis for critical decisions without human
                        verification.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-info">2. Accuracy of Recognition</h4>
                    <p>Face recognition technology is subject to various factors that can affect accuracy, including
                        lighting conditions, camera quality, subject positioning, and partial obstructions. Users are
                        advised that recognition "confidence" scores are indicators and may occasionally result in false
                        positives or false negatives (mistaken identity or failure to recognize).</p>

                    <p>This application processes biometric data (facial features) locally. No facial data is
                        transmitted to external cloud services. However, the security of the local machine and data
                        storage remains the responsibility of the system administrator.</p>

                        indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use this
                        system, or from errors in attendance records generated by the automated recognition logic.</p>
